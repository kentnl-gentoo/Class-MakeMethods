NAME
    Class::MakeMethods::Docs::ReadMe - About Class::MakeMethods 1.006

DESCRIPTION
    This is an updated release of Class::MakeMethods, for distribution
    through CPAN. This release includes the Class::MakeMethods::Template and
    Class::MakeMethods::Emulator modules which were previously distributed
    separately.

MOTIVATION
    Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

      By passing arguments to "use Class::MakeMethods ..." statements,
      you can select from a library of hundreds of common types of
      methods, which are dynamically generated and installed as
      subroutines in your module, simplifying the code for your class.

SEE ALSO
    Documentation is available in POD format throughout the distribution;
    the Class::MakeMethods manpage is a good starting place. Plain-text
    versions of some kew documentation are also available in the docs/
    directory.

    You may browse the latest distribution online here:

INSTALLATION
    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

    If this module has not yet been posted to your local CPAN mirror, you
    may also retrieve the current distribution from the above web address
    and follow the normal "gunzip", "tar xf", "cd", "perl Makefile.PL &&
    make test && sudo make install" procedure or your local equivalent.
