NAME
    Class::MakeMethods::Docs::ReadMe - About Class::MakeMethods

DESCRIPTION
    This is an updated release of Class::MakeMethods, for distribution
    through CPAN. This release includes the Class::MakeMethods::Template and
    Class::MakeMethods::Emulator modules which were previously distributed
    separately.

MOTIVATION
    Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

      By passing arguments to "use Class::MakeMethods ..." statements,
      you can select from a library of hundreds of common types of
      methods, which are dynamically generated and installed as
      subroutines in your module, simplifying the code for your class.

DISTRIBUTION AND INSTALLATION
  Version

    This is Class::MakeMethods v1.009, intended for general use.

    This module's CPAN registration should read:

      Name            DSLIP  Description
      --------------  -----  ---------------------------------------------
      Class::
      ::MakeMethods   RdpOp  Generate common types of methods

  Prerequisites

    In general, this module should work with Perl 5.003 or later, without
    requring any modules beyond the core Perl distribution.

    The following optional feature may not be available on some platforms:

    *   Class::MakeMethods::Attribute: The ":MakeMethod" subroutine
        attribute requires Perl version 5.6 and the Attribute::Handlers
        module (from CPAN).

    *   Class::MakeMethods::Template "--lvalue": The lvalue modifier
        provided by the Template generator subclasses will only work on Perl
        version 5.6 or later.

  Installation

    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Class::MakeMethods'

    Alternately, you may retrieve this package from CPAN or from the
    author's site:

    * http://search.cpan.org/~evo/

    * http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/E/EV/EVO

    * http://www.evoscript.org/Class-MakeMethods/dist/

    After downloading the distribution, follow the normal procedure to
    unpack and install it, using the commands shown below or their local
    equivalents on your system:

      tar xzf Class-MakeMethods-*.tar.gz
      cd Class-MakeMethods-*
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test && sudo make install

    Thanks to the kind generosity of other members of the Perl community,
    this distribution is also available repackaged in the FreeBSD "ports"
    and Linux RPM formats. This may simplify installation for some users,
    but be aware that these alternate distributions may lag a few versions
    behind the latest release on CPAN.

  Tested Platforms

    This release has been tested succesfully on the following platforms:

      5.6.1 on darwin

    Earlier releases have also tested OK on the following platforms:

      IP30-R12000-irix
      OpenBSD.i386-openbsd
      i386-freebsd / i386-freebsd-thread-multi
      i386-linux
      i386-netbsd / i386-netbsd-thread-multi
      i586-linux / i586-linux-thread-multi-ld
      i686-linux / i686-pld-linux-thread-multi
      ia64-linux
      ppc-linux
      sparc-linux
      sparc-netbsd
      sun4-solaris

    Some earlier versions failed to "make test" on MSWin32, although a
    forced installation would still work; that problem should be fixed in
    the most recent releases.

BUGS AND SUPPORT
  Release Status

    This module has been used in a variety of production systems and has
    been available on CPAN for over two years, with several other
    distributions dependant on it, so it would be fair to say that it is
    fully released.

    However, while some portions are well tested, others are less so, and
    new bug reports do trickle in occasionally. If you do encounter any
    problems, please inform the author and I'll endeavor to patch them
    promptly.

    Additional features have been outlined for future development, but the
    intent is support these by adding more options to the declaration
    interface, while maintaining backward compatibility.

  Known Problems

    It does not appear to be possible to assign subroutine names to closures
    within Perl. As a result, debugging output from Carp and similar sources
    will show all generated methods as "ANON()" rather than
    "YourClass::methodname()".

    See the Class::MakeMethods::Docs::ToDo manpage for other outstanding
    issues and development plans.

  Support

    If you have questions or feedback about this module, please feel free to
    contact the author at the below address. Although there is no formal
    support program, I do attempt to answer email promptly.

    I would be particularly interested in any suggestions towards improving
    the documentation, correcting any Perl-version or platform dependencies,
    as well as general feedback and suggested additions.

    Bug reports that contain a failing test case are greatly appreciated,
    and suggested patches will be promptly considered for inclusion in
    future releases.

    To report bugs via the CPAN web tracking system, go to
    "http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Class-MakeMethods" or send
    mail to "Dist=Class-MakeMethods#rt.cpan.org", replacing "#" with "@".
