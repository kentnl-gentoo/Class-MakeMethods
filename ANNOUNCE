ANNOUNCE: Class::MakeMethods 1.0.15

This is the second release of Class::MakeMethods to CPAN.

Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

  By passing arguments to "use Class::MakeMethods ..." statements,
  you can select from a library of hundreds of common types of
  methods, which are dynamically generated and installed as
  subroutines in your module, simplifying the code for your class.

A further description of the module is in this readme: 
  http://www.evoscript.org/Class-MakeMethods/docs/ReadMe.html

The "getting started guide" contains an introduction and examples: 
  http://www.evoscript.org/Class-MakeMethods/docs/ReadMe.html

To install, download the tarball and use your normal "make" procedure: 
  http://www.evoscript.org/Class-MakeMethods/dist/

Suggestions and comments would be much appreciated. 

In particular, I'd be interested in answers to these questions:
- Is the getting-started guide helpful? What about the documentation
  for the individual subclasses, like Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash?
- Does it test cleanly on various platforms, under Perl 5.004 through
  wherever bleedperl is these days?
- Can you find the methods that might be useful to you? Anything missing? 
  What would make the module more useful to you?

Please send any feedback to me at simonm@evolution.com.

Thanks,

-Simon
