ANNOUNCE: Class::MakeMethods 1.0.14

This is the first release of Class::MakeMethods intended for upload to CPAN

Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

  By passing arguments to "use Class::MakeMethods ..." statements,
  you can select from a library of hundreds of common types of
  methods, which are dynamically generated and installed as
  subroutines in your module, simplifying the code for your class.

Suggestions and comments would be much appreciated. 

In particular, I'd be interested in answers to these questions:
- Does the "Class::MakeMethods" name make sense on first read? 
- Is the getting-started guide helpful? What about the documentation
  for the individual subclasses, like Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Hash?
- Does it test cleanly on various platforms, under Perl 5.004 through
  wherever bleedperl is these days?
- Can you find the methods that might be useful to you? Anything missing? 
  What would make the module more useful to you?

Please send any feedback to me at simonm@evolution.com.

Thanks,

-Simon
