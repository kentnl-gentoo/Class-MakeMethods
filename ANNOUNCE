ANNOUNCE: Class::MakeMethods 1.003

This is the second release of Class::MakeMethods to CPAN.

Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

  By passing arguments to "use Class::MakeMethods ..." statements,
  you can select from a library of hundreds of common types of
  methods, which are dynamically generated and installed as
  subroutines in your module, simplifying the code for your class.

Further information and module documentation is available here: 

  http://www.evoscript.org/Class-MakeMethods/

You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
interface:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Class::MakeMethods'

If this module has not yet been posted to your local CPAN mirror, you
may also retrieve the current distribution from the above web address and
follow the normal "gunzip", "tar xf", "cd", "perl Makefile.PL && make
test && sudo make install" procedure or your local equivalent:

Suggestions and comments would be much appreciated. 

Please send any feedback to me at simonm@evolution.com.

Thanks,
